Early preview of all new version of GeoGen Studio.

The Studio is currently being rewritten from scratch using the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation WPF] technology. Main focus are user interface improvements and extensible modular architecture.

No release date is currently set. 

No previews versions were released (though you can download the [http://code.google.com/p/geogen/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fwpf source code branch] and build it yourself, however you have to expect severe issues and unfinished features).

=== <font color="red">*Warning*</font>: All of this is unpolished work-in-progress and may be subject to change. ===

- *Redesigned user interface* - Graphical design of the application will be much more polished. Map and overlay selection boxes will contain illustrating previews. Full screen mode will be supported. Whole application will correctly scale with the system DPI setting.
